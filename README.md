# Things that had to be printed

It turns out, some CS professors prefers assignments submitted on paper, rather
than on file. Quite possibly due to lack of ink, paper, printer, and/or
computer in their office, just as expected from a CS professor.

However, code-on-paper has one great weakness: they cannot be compiled/executed
by the computer directly. If one were to do that, one would need to do OCR, or
one would have to type the whole thing back into a file. Considering the lack
of ink/etc in the office, I would not expect them to have a good mean of OCR.
And thus, I must conclude that there are some poor souls that have to type the
whole source code, or that the code will never be really tested. Assuming the
former, I decided to put my code-that-had-to-be-printed online too, so I can
lessen the suffering of mankind. In case of latter, doing this probably doesn't
hurt anyone, so it's fine.

To make sure no one else tries to submit my code and still look like one wasn't
late, code shall be committed and pushed after the submission.
